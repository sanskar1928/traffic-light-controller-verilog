# Traffic Light Controller using Verilog (FSM)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a traffic light control system for a four-way intersection using Verilog HDL. The design is based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) approach to ensure safe and systematic control of traffic signals.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog / ModelSim
- GTKWave (for waveform analysis)

## ⚙️ Features
- Four-way traffic signal control
- Finite State Machine based design
- Red, Yellow, and Green signal timing
- Fully simulation-based (no hardware required)

## 🧠 Design Approach
The controller operates in predefined states corresponding to traffic signal phases. State transitions occur based on clock timing, ensuring proper synchronization of all traffic directions.
